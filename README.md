# Amazon Sales Insight Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data from three Amazon branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The dataset consists of 1000 rows and 17 columns, including invoice details, product lines, prices, quantities, taxes, dates, and customer demographics. The goal is to leverage this data to enhance sales strategies, improve product offerings, and gain a deeper understanding of customer segments.
